# Dashboard

This project provides a dashboard to manage cs2 kz api.

## Set up

Before starting the frontend, make sure you have set up the [api](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/cs2kz-api).

Change `VITE_API_URL` to the api url in `.env`.

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Run the app in dev mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once it starts, you can access the app through `127.0.0.1`.
